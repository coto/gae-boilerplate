=== What's a Boilerplate?
A Boilerplate is used to describe sections of code that can be reused over and over in new contexts or applications which provides good default values, reducing the need to specify program details in every project. ({wikipedia}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code])

=== What makes this Boilerplate Amazing?
It is fully featured, actively maintained, and uses the latest technologies supported by Google App Engine.

New to Google App Engine? Learn about it by watching {this video}[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfgO-LXGpTM] or reading {this website}[https://developers.google.com/appengine/].

== Just 6 easy steps

1. Run locally ({instructions}[https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver]).
1. Set your 'application' name in {app.yaml}[https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/app.yaml]
1. Set parameters in {config.py}[https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/config.py].  (secret key, {recaptcha code}[http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha], salt etc.)
1. Deploy it to your own app ({instructions}[https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/uploading])

== Help us translate and add new languages
This boilerplate comes bundled with babel, pytz, and automatic language detection which together provide powerful internationalization capability.

Text to be translated needs to be indicated in code and then translated by users like you after which it is compiled for speed.
If you know english and another language, <b>please help us translate</b> by skipping to step 5 below (provide translations). It requires no special tools except the ability to 
download the boilerplate and commit it back to github.  Once committed you may ask us to perform step 6 for you (compile the translations).

Adding or updating text to be translated or adding new languages requires more work as indicated in the steps below:
1. Text to be translated should be enclosed in _("text to translate") in *.py files.  In html templates translated text is indicated by:
   1. <tt>{% trans %}text to translate{% endtrans %}</tt>
   1. <tt>{{..._("text to translate")...}}</tt>
   1. <tt>{%..._("text to translate")...%}</tt>
   Translations can be added to other types of files too.  See {babel.cfg}[https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/locale/babel.cfg]
   and {babel.cfg documentation}[http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/0.9/messages.html]
1. Obtain pybabel to perform the steps below.  You will need to install and compile {babel}[http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Download].
   Note that you may need to first install {setuptools and easy_install}[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools].
   pybabel.exe can be run from the Scripts directory in your python installation.
1. Babel then needs to find all translationed text blocks throughout code and templates.
   After installing pybabl run this command to extract messages (assuming ./ is the location of this boilerplate):
   <tt>pybabel extract -F ./locale/babel.cfg -o ./locale/messages.pot ./ --sort-output --no-location --omit-header</tt>
1. Update translations of existing languages or add new languages
   1. Update translations of existing languages by running this command for each locale:
      <tt>pybabel update -l es_ES -d ./locale -i ./locale/messages.pot --previous --ignore-obsolete</tt>
      Run this command for each locale by replacing es_ES in the command.  Locale names are the directory names in ./locale.
   1. Add new languages
      Run this command for each new language to add.  You will need to replace es_ES in the command with the locale code to add.
      pybabel init -l es_ES -d ./locale -i ./locale\messages.pot
      See the comments at the top of {i18n.py}[https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/lib/i18n.py] to learn how to define locale codes.
      Add the locale code to the AVAILABLE_LOCALES and LANGUAGES arrays in {i18n.py}[https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/lib/i18n.py].
      Add the locale to the language selection dropdown code in base.html if necessary.
1. Provide translations for each language
   In each locale/<locale code>/LC_MESSAGES directory there is a file messages.po. Please help us translate the text in these files.
   msgid is the text in English.  msgstr is the translation to the language indicated by the locale code.  For example:
   
   <tt>msgid "Change your password"</tt>
   <tt>msgstr "Cambiar tu contrase�a"</tt>
1. Compile translations
   Run: <tt>pybabel compile -f -d ./locale</tt>

See {webapp2's tutorial}[http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/tutorials/i18n.html] and {pybabel's docs}[http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/cmdline.html] for more details.
