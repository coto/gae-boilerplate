Hello {{first_name}}!

The password for your account (@{{username}}) - {{email}} - was recently changed.
If you made this change, you don't need to do anything more.

If you didn't change your password, your account might have been hijacked. To
get back into your account, you'll need to reset your password by clicking this
link: {{reset_password_url}}.

Important account security tips:
1. Never give out your password or personal information by email or on social networks. We will never contact you to ask you for your password.
2. Never use the same password for this site and other websites.

Sincerely,
Team Boilerplate
